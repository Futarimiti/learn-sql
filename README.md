### Note

5 Apr 2022 update: this series was finished and would probably not be updated anymore.

This study note is for MySQL exclusively;
some features may not be sharing in other DBMSs especially ones with stricter syntax.
They were sometimes mentioned in the context but of course not limited to those.
