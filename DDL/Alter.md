# Altering table structure

The structure of a table may being changed by adding, removing and modifying fields.

### Cost in development

Altering table structure often leads to massive code changes on querying;
hence once determined, structure of a table is seldom changed.

### Syntax

An `ALTER TABLE` clause makes modifications to the structure of the table.

The exact syntax on using `ALTER TABLE` can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html).
